        <center><h1>How to take care of your cat</h1></center>
        <p>With their playful personality and affectionate demeanor, the cat can be the perfect pet. But, despite public opinion, cats are not without maintenance! To keep your cat healthy and happy, you need to know how to take care of it.</p>
        <center><h2><strong>Tip#1. Groom your cat regularly</strong></h2></center>
        <p>Whether your cat has a short or long coat, regular brushing benefits not only you and your home, but also its health. This removes dead hair from his coat so he doesn't ingest it while grooming himself. Grooming also gives the opportunity to notice any changes in its skin and to detect parasites (ticks, fleas, etc.) and 
            signs of disease. Brushing is much easier if you train your pet to accept this activity from an early age. Many products exist to groom your cat. There is in particular the Vetocanis carding brush which untangles knots, removes dead hair and under hair, to leave a shiny and pleasant coat.
        </p>

        <p>You should also be sure to check your kitten's claws regularly. You need to trim them regularly with nail clippers to prevent them from growing into their legs. If you start the routine as soon as she arrives, you'll find that the task becomes easier as your cat ages. Ask your vet to show you how to clip the claws.</p>

        <center><h2><strong>Tip#2. Give them fresh water every day</strong></h2></center>
        <p>Clean, fresh water is essential to your cat's good health. If your cat doesn't seem to drink from a bowl, consider providing a tall glass (some cats don't like to bend down to drink) or a cat fountain. Be sure to provide it with fresh water every day and change the water when it is no longer clean. Also make sure to give him a sufficient amount of kibble. A good diet allows your pet to maintain good health.</p>

        <center><h2><strong>Tip#3. Make sure you have enough litter</strong></h2></center>
        <p>How much litter for your cat? As a general rule, you need as many boxes as there are cats in the house, plus one. If you have two cats, then you must have three litter boxes. To encourage good litter habits, keep litter boxes clean. Regular cleaning will also help you notice any changes in your pet's urine or stool, which could indicate a health problem.</p>
