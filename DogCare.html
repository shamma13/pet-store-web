        <center><h1>How to take care of your dog</h1></center>
        <p>Your dog will be a faithful friend throughout his life. To keep him healthy and happy, here are some tips to ensure his well-being and the best of cohabitations.</p>
        <center><h2><strong>Tip#1. Train your dog</strong></h2></center>
        <p><strong>A well-behaved dog is a happy dog</strong> because he knows his limits and knows he can count on you. Teach him
        <strong>to be clean </strong>, as well as<strong> some simple commands</strong>, such as knowing how to walk on a leash, to sit down, to go to his basket, or not to bite.
        Also get him used to being handled to receive simple care, such as brushing him, cleaning his eyes and ears, or even cutting his claws. This will allow you to have a serene and stress-free relationship. </p>
        <p>Start training your dog as soon as you adopt him. Although a puppy learns faster, education can be done at any age. Patience will be your best ally. Don't forget to reward your dog with petting and treats, so that the exercise session turns into a game for him.</p>

        <center><h2><strong>Tip#2. Take care of your dog's daily hygiene</strong></h2></center>
        <p>Just like you, your dog needs a few daily hygiene gestures to preserve his health and well-being.</p>
        <p>Clean his eyes and ears regularly, with cleansing lotions specially designed to remove secretions and dust. Some breeds of dog, such as Shar Pei or bulldogs, need special maintenance of these areas, due to the folds in their skin.</p>

        <center><h2><strong>Tip#3. Give your dog a balanced diet and fresh water</strong></h2></center>
        <p>A balanced diet allows your pet to maintain good health. The amount of food depends on its age, weight and metabolism. To preserve his health, prefer to give him a diet adapted to the dog, whether it is his food or his treats. 
            Indeed, some of our favorite foods are toxic to him, such as chocolate (read: Dog and cat: our 10 toxic foods for them).</p>
        
        <p>Some dogs will eat their daily ration in one or two meals, others will prefer to eat throughout the day. It's up to you to adapt the pace according to your lifestyle.</p>

        <p>Clean, fresh water is essential to your dog's good health. Be sure to provide it with fresh water every day and change the water when it is no longer clean. Wash his bowl regularly, to avoid dirt and bacteria.</p>
